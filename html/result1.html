                    Mostly you experience stress and anxiety from time to time. Stress is any demand placed on your brain or physical body. You can report feeling stressed when multiple competing demands are placed on. The feeling of being stressed can be triggered by an event that makes you feel frustrated or nervous. 
                    However, if stress and anxiety begin interfering with your daily life, it may indicate a more serious issue. If you are avoiding situations due to irrational fears, constantly worrying, or experiencing severe anxiety about a traumatic event weeks after it happened, it may be time to seek help.
