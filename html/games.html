    <h4>1. <a href="https://skribbl.io/" target="_blank">SCRIBBLE</a><br> <br>This is the game you can play with friends
    </h4>

    <h4>2. <a href="http://powerline.io/" target="_blank">Powerline </a><br><br> Remember playing Snake on the
        indestructible Nokia phone? In this version you’re not just a neon snake — you’re competing with other neon
        snakes for supremacy. </h4>

    <h4>3. <a href="https://nobrakesio.totebo.com/" target="_blank">NO brakes </a><br><br> Simply use your arrow keys to
        steer and you’re off to the races! NoBrakes.io is a multiplayer racing game where you reach checkpoints to gain
        a competitive advantage with power-ups that boost your speed or slow others down.</h4>

    <h4>4. <a href="https://everybodyedits.com/" target="_blank">EVERYBODY EDITS</a> <br><br> Entrepreneur and developer
        Chris Benjaminsen created this real-time, multiplayer platform game. But the players are the ones who can build
        levels for others to try and complete.</h4>

    <h4>5. <a href="https://www.battleon.com/" target="_blank">ADVENTURE QUEST</a> <br><br> AdventureQuest is a
        single-player RPG wherein you create a character, pick a class, and fight against hordes of monsters. <br> Depending
        on your personality, you can choose to be a <br> ninja, wizard, fighter, rogue, or paladin (to name just a few).</h4>

    <h4>6. <a href="https://pokemonshowdown.com/" target="_blank">POKEMON SHOWDOWN</a> <br><br>Children and grown-ups
        alike love this online battle simulator. <br> It’s like playing the Pokémon video games without having to put in
        the
        work. <br> No waiting to rest or level up — you just jump straight into battle. <br>
        You can build a custom team if you have a preference for the Pokémon you want to use, <br> or you can join a
        random
        one and battle with whatever you get. Instead of the goal to <br> “catch ‘em all,” now you can beat ‘em all!
    </h4>

    <h4>7. <a href="http://www.neopets.com/index.phtml" target="_blank">NEOPETS</a> <br><br>In November 1999, game
        designers Adam and Donna Powell released arguably one of the best <br> browser games: Neopets. Neopets is a
        virtual
        pet website where players can own virtual pets and care for <br> them using neocash.
        20 years later, Neopets still exists and is active thanks to its beloved events, <br> dailies, pet customization
        and
        community.</h4>
