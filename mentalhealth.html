            <p> Mental health includes our emotional, psychological, and social well-being. <br> It affects how we
                think,
                feel, and act. <br> It also helps determine how we handle stress, relate to others, and make choices.
                Mental health is important at every stage of life, from childhood and adolescence through adulthood.
                <br>
                Over the course of your life, if you experience mental health problems, your thinking, mood, and
                behavior
                could be affected. <br> <br> Many factors contribute to mental health problems, including: <br>
                <b>
                    • Biological factors, such as genes or brain chemistry <br>
                    • Life experiences, such as trauma or abuse <br>
                    • Family history of mental health problems <br>
                </b> <br>

                Mental health problems are common but help is available. People with mental health problems can get
                better
                and many recover completely.
